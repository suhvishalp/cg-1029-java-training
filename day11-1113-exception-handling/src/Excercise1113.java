/*
 * Exercise: Employee Management System with Exception Handling

Create an Employee Management System with three layers:

BO (Business Object) - Employee class, representing employee data with validation.
Service Layer - EmployeeService class, managing business operations on employees.
DAO Layer - EmployeeDAO class, managing data operations with custom exceptions.
The system should handle the following exceptions:

Custom Exceptions:
EmployeeNotFoundException: Raised when an employee is not found.
InvalidEmployeeDataException: Raised when employee data is invalid (e.g., age below 18, missing PAN number).
Runtime Exceptions: Handle general runtime exceptions like NullPointerException and NumberFormatException.
